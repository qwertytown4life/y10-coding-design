hi ms yearwood o/

this is contains all of the code of my website. if you would like to run it on your computer, make sure to type in the server address of your computer by running the python script first and copying that address into the javascript file titles 'backend.js' at the top into 'url'. after this you should be able to run code on the website. (also make sure you have react and axios installed).
